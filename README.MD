# Useful Python Functions
## In a Class of Their Own
This file contains a class of useful functions.  As I come across them, I'll try to remember to update the readme here with a list.

* format_name
Change first and last name variables to be Title Case (first letter capitalized, the rest all lower case)
* reverse
Reverse the entered string, list, etc
* dpi_off
Disables DPI auto scaling on Windows 8/10/11 machines.  I have honestly no idea how DPI scaling on other OSes works, but on Windows it can *really* mess with an image/app.  FULL credit to
* string_to_list
Accept a string as input, spitting out the characters in list form.
EX: 'ScaerieTale' returns ['S', 'c', a', e', r', 'i', 'e', 'T', 'a', 'l', 'e']
